# Delphi Web Tool by Cyber3

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

A web application designed to administer Delphi studies to collect expert inputs on cybersecurity education.

### Additional information about the project

Our team plans on developing a web application aimed at facilitating research utilizing the Delphi method. The Delphi method is utilized to gather consensus from subject matter experts while keeping identities anonymous and maintaining quality control on the results, a scientific method for consulting a group of experts. Utilizing multiple rounds of activities, the administrators can refine results until a reasonable consensus is reached by administrators. With the development of our platform, we aim to provide a tool for cybersecurity educators and professionals with integrated tools, user protection, and a clean user experience for both administrators and survey takers.
